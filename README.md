# Survivable-Arms
Prevents arm mech components from being completely destroyed if you only destroyed the side torso of a mech.

# Installation instructions


Place the mod folder inside the game's mod folder:

WIN: C:\Users\user_name\MyDocuments\MyGames\BattleTech\mods
LIN: /home/user_name/MyGames/BattleTech/mods
OSX: /Users/user_name/MyGames/BattleTech/mods

If the above folder doesn't exist, you need to start Battletech to have it create the folder.

If you get a message about needing to overwrite the folder, click yes: either you're updating the mod (in which case you should be replacing it),
or you're installing another mod from me, in which case your OS should be smart enough to merge the conflicting folders.
